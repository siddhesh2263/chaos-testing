# Chaos Testing on a K3s (Kubernetes) Cluster

## What is chaos testing?

Chaos testing is the practice of deliberately injecting failures into a system to observe how it behaves under stress or partial outage. The goal is to identify weaknesses in the system and its recovery mechanisms â€” before real-world failures occur. Chaos testing helps surface hidden assumptions, brittle dependencies, and unmonitored failure modes.

### Key characteristics of chaos testing:
1. It is controlled - meaning failures are introduced in a known, observable way.
2. It is repeatable - meaning scenarios can be replayed to verify fixes.
3. It is measured - meaning metrics, logs, and alerts are used to assess system behaviour and overall impact.
4. It can be incremental - meaning we can start with small faults, and then expans to compound failures.
